"""S12: Vedic Fractional Alpha — Ancient Indian Mathematics Meets Anomalous Diffusion.

Fuses four pillars of ancient Indian mathematics with modern fractional calculus:
  1. Ramanujan Mock Theta Functions — hidden periodicity detection
  2. Madhava Angular Kernel — nonlinear regime coherence
  3. Aryabhata Sine-Difference Phase — oscillation timing
  4. Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation — anomalous diffusion regime classification

Core thesis: The fractional diffusion order α classifies market regimes,
while the three ancient mathematical frameworks provide signal generation
and entry timing within each regime.
