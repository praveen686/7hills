# SLR Sensitivity Grid C v1: Spread-Aware + Cost-Aware
#
# Post Grid-B findings:
# - Grid B with high d_perp + unanimity = 0 trades (too restrictive)
# - Need spread veto to avoid wide-spread entries (economics)
# - Keep direction and instability gates, but add spread filter
#
# Design principles:
# - 4 knobs only: min_d_perp, tau_dir_enter, u_aggressive, max_spread_bps_entry
# - Spread veto prevents entering when bid-ask too wide
# - Keep anti-churn controls fixed
#
# Grid size: 3 x 2 x 2 x 4 = 48 runs (fast, focused)
