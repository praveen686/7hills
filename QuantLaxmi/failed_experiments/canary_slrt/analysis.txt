SLRT Canary — Failed Experiment Report
=======================================
Date: 2026-02-03

Objective
---------
Test whether the SLRT signal (regime classification + imbalance + FTI)
predicts short-term BTC price direction well enough to be profitable
under taker fees (0.1% per side = ~20 bps round trip).

Configuration
-------------
Canary mode: permissive gates to maximize trade count.
  - Allowed regimes: R0, R1, R2, R3 (all)
  - Confidence min: 0.55
  - Toxicity max: 1.00
  - Imbalance min: 0.05
  - Cooldown: 0s
  - No FTI confirmation required
  - Qty: 0.001 BTC

Three runs with different exit configs:

Run A (slrt_20260203_165446)
  TP/SL: 8 bps, time_stop: 60s
  Result: 25 trades, gross -$0.28, net -$4.11
  Issue: TP < round-trip fees. Mathematically impossible to profit.

Run B (slrt_20260203_171619)
  TP/SL: 30 bps, time_stop: 60s
  Result: 70 trades, gross -$0.85, net -$11.39
  Issue: 91% TIME exits. Price doesn't move 30 bps in 60s.

Run C (slrt_20260203_184250)
  TP/SL: 40 bps, time_stop: 300s
  Result: 117 trades, gross -$2.66, net -$20.37
  Issue: 73% TIME exits. Gross PnL is negative.

Verdict
-------
GROSS PnL IS NEGATIVE across all configurations.

This means the SLRT signal does not predict direction.
It's not a fee problem or an exit problem — the signal itself has no edge.

The clean fork:
  "If gross is negative, stop arguing about exits and move to alpha work."

What Was Proven
---------------
+ Engineering pipeline is correct (trades, exits, logging, summaries)
+ Fee analysis is sound (break-even ~20 bps for taker)
+ Falsified: "SLRT signal has short-term directional edge on BTC"
