# SLR Sensitivity Grid B: Edge-Hunting (Post Fee-Bug Analysis)
#
# Based on tournament A findings:
# - d_perp is the primary discriminator for signal quality
# - Churn kills profitability (fees dominate)
# - Need rare, high-conviction trades with less crossing
#
# Design principles:
# - Push min_d_perp into p98-p99.7 territory (rare structural shocks)
# - Force tau_dir_enter=3 (unanimity required)
# - Increase u_aggressive to reduce taker frequency
# - Increase hold time to let signal play out
#
# Grid size: 3 x 1 x 3 x 3 = 27 runs (fast, focused)

[params]
# d_perp: rare structural shocks (higher threshold = fewer trades)
