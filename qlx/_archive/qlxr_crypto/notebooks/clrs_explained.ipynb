    "## 1. What Are Perpetual Futures?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Futures (Traditional Finance)\n",
    "A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell something at a fixed price on a **specific date**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: \"I'll buy 1 Bitcoin at $100,000 on March 31st\"\n",
    "- The contract **expires** on that date — it has a shelf life\n",
    "- As expiry approaches, the futures price converges to the spot (real) price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perpetual Futures (Crypto Innovation)\n",
    "Crypto exchanges invented **perpetual futures** — contracts that **never expire**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can hold a position forever\n",
    "- But without expiry, how do you keep the futures price close to the real price?\n",
    "- Answer: **Funding Rates** — a periodic payment between longs and shorts\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Funding Rate Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Every **8 hours** (at 00:00, 08:00, 16:00 UTC on Binance), a cash transfer happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Futures Price vs Spot | Who Pays | Who Receives |\n",
    "|----------|----------------------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Bullish demand | Futures > Spot (positive rate) | Longs pay | Shorts receive |\n",
    "| Bearish demand | Futures < Spot (negative rate) | Shorts pay | Longs receive |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** When everyone is bullish and buying futures, the funding rate goes positive — meaning longs PAY shorts. This is the edge we harvest."

    "## 2. The Opportunity: Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retail Speculation Creates Predictable Cash Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "Meme coins and hyped altcoins attract **one-directional speculation**:\n",
    "- Retail traders pile into long positions on trending coins\n",
    "- This pushes the perpetual futures price **above** the spot price\n",
    "- The funding rate goes **highly positive** (sometimes 100%+ annualized)\n",
    "- These speculators are **paying us** to take the other side\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Strategy in Plain English\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scan** the market for coins with very high funding rates (>20% annualized)\n",
    "2. **Enter** a short position on the perpetual future (and conceptually long spot)\n",
    "3. **Collect** funding payments every 8 hours\n",
    "4. **Exit** when the funding rate drops below 3% (the hype is over)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not betting on price direction. We're collecting a **steady cash flow** from retail speculators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Major Coins Don't Work\n",
    "\n",
    "BTC, ETH, SOL have **capped** funding rates at ±0.01% per 8 hours (~10.95% annualized). The real opportunities are on smaller coins with **uncapped** rates — we've seen rates above 300% annualized on meme coins."

    "\n",
    "Binance reports funding as a **per-settlement fraction** (e.g., 0.003 = 0.3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "To annualize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Annualized Rate} = \\text{Funding Rate} \\times 3 \\times 365 \\times 100\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The $\\times 3$ is because there are 3 settlements per day (every 8 hours)\n",
    "- The $\\times 365$ converts daily to yearly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A funding rate of 0.003 (0.3% per 8h) = 0.3% × 3 × 365 = **328.5% annualized**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Return Per Settlement\n",
    "\n",
    "If we hold a position with weight $w$ and the funding rate is $r$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Funding Earned} = r \\times w$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With equal-weight positions across $N$ symbols:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w = \\frac{1}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Every trade costs **8 basis points** (0.08%) per leg:\n",
    "- Entry: 8 bps\n",
    "- Exit: 8 bps\n",
    "- **Round trip: 16 bps**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a position earning 100% annualized:\n",
    "- Per settlement: 100% / (3 × 365) ≈ **0.091%** = 9.1 bps\n",
    "- It takes ~2 settlements to pay back the entry cost\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Adverse Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all high-funding moments are safe to enter. Sometimes the funding rate is high because **informed traders know something** — maybe the price is about to crash.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is VPIN?\n",
    "\n",
    "**VPIN** = Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Invented by Easley, Lopez de Prado & O'Hara (2012), VPIN measures the **probability that current trading is driven by informed traders** (people who know something the market doesn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VPIN ≈ 0.3**: Normal market. Market makers are safe. We're safe.\n",
    "- **VPIN ≈ 0.5**: Moderate informed trading. Proceed with caution.\n",
    "- **VPIN > 0.8**: High toxicity. Informed traders dominating. **Stay out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How VPIN Works (Simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea: if a trade moves the price up, it's probably a **buy**. If it moves price down, it's a **sell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "VPIN measures the **imbalance** between buys and sells over equal-volume buckets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide trades into volume buckets** (each $50,000 of volume)\n",
    "2. **Classify each trade**: Using the price change, estimate the probability it was a buy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{buy}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\log(P_t / P_{t-1})}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\Phi$ is the normal CDF and $\\sigma$ is recent volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute imbalance per bucket**: $|V_{\\text{buy}} - V_{\\text{sell}}|$\n",
    "4. **Average over last 50 buckets**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{VPIN} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{|V^{\\text{buy}}_i - V^{\\text{sell}}_i|}{V_{\\text{bucket}}}$$\n",

    "The edge comes from **behavioral finance** — specifically, the **demand for leverage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retail traders overpay for leverage.** When a meme coin is trending, retail traders pile into leveraged long positions. They're willing to pay high funding rates because they expect the price to moon.\n",

    "   - The price corrects\n",

    "### Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tick data overrides kline data**: When the tick collector has warmed up for a symbol, its VPIN/OFI/Hawkes values replace the kline-based approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **VPIN filtering is source-aware**: Tick VPIN (entry < 0.80, exit > 0.90) is applied only when tick data is available AND warmed up. Kline VPIN is disabled (set to 0.99) because it's too noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Atomic state persistence**: The portfolio state is written via `tmp + rename` pattern — the file is always valid, even if the process crashes mid-write.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Watchdog cron**: A cron job every 5 minutes checks if the paper trader is running and restarts it if not. This ensures 24/7 uptime."

    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "A **funding rate carry harvester** that:\n",
    "- Scans 400+ perpetual futures every 5 minutes for high funding rates\n",
    "- Enters short carry positions when funding > 20% annualized\n",
    "- Collects funding payments every 8 hours (3× daily)\n",
    "- Exits when funding drops below 3%\n",
    "- Filters entries using tick-level VPIN to avoid toxic flow\n",
    "- Runs 24/7 with automatic restart via watchdog cron\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Math That Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Formula | What It Tells Us |\n",
    "|---------|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| Annualized Funding | $r \\times 3 \\times 365$ | How much we earn per year |\n",
    "| VPIN | $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\frac{\\|V_b - V_s\\|}{V_{bucket}}$ | Probability of informed trading |\n",
    "| BVC Classification | $\\Phi(\\Delta P / \\sigma)$ | Is this trade a buy or sell? |\n",
    "| Hawkes Intensity | $\\mu + \\sum \\alpha e^{-\\beta \\Delta t}$ | Is this a liquidation cascade? |\n",
    "| Kyle's Lambda | $\\Delta P = \\lambda V + \\epsilon$ | How fragile is this market? |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtest Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **90-day backtest**: +5.29% average return, Sharpe 11.86\n",
    "- **9 out of 10 symbols profitable**\n",
    "- **Max drawdown: 1.34%** (very low risk)\n",
    "- Best performer: ARCUSDT at +24.61% (Sharpe 31.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail traders overpay for leverage on hyped coins. We collect the premium they pay. The edge is structural — as long as retail speculation exists (and it always will in crypto), there will be high funding rates to harvest."
